Predictive analysis is a cornerstone of modern healthcare as it helps foreseeing what happens to 
patients based on available information. The study seeks to predict the number of days (LOS) 
that people with different cardiovascular diagnoses such as coronary atherosclerosis (CAS), heart 
failure (HF), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) stay in hospitals. This will be done through 
development of robust predictive models using MIT MIMIC-III database powered by machine 
learning algorithms like random forest and gradient tree boosting ensemble methods which 
contain patient demographics among other diagnosis categories along with clinical information 
necessary for LOS prediction. The team will preprocess data, engineer features and perform 
regression modelling with an aim of accurately forecasting LOS upon admission into hospital 
using Python libraries including but not limited to Pandas and scikit-learn. With this effort, they 
hope to help in efficient allocation of resources as well as improving care provision while also 
streamlining operations within hospitals. All users must adhere to ethical guidelines when 
accessing MIMIC database so that patientsâ€™ privacy rights are upheld during research activities 
involving their personal records.
